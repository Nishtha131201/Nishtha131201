# Hey, I'm Nishtha 👋

I'm a software and data engineer who believes that clean code, thoughtful architecture, and the right bit of curiosity can move mountains 🏔️.

### 💼 What I Do

I design and build systems that solve real problems—whether it’s streamlining data workflows, automating business processes, or crafting reliable backend services. My toolbox includes **Java**, **Python**, **React**, **AWS**, **Docker**, and a growing love for distributed systems.

I enjoy bridging structured data with user-focused design, and turning complex challenges into simple, scalable solutions.

### 🌱 Outside the Terminal...

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:

🗻 **On a hike** – always chasing fresh air and panoramic views  
✈️ **Exploring new places** – spontaneous trips keep life interesting  
🎥 **Watching anime** – from deep philosophical plots to chaotic battle arcs  
🐈 **Hanging out with my two cats** – expert bug chasers and laptop blockers  
🍵 **Sipping tea** – masala, green, herbal... if it's warm and calming, I'm in
